"""In-memory N-ary dependency graph used for traversing software stacks.

As number of possible software stacks can be really huge, let's construct
N-ary dependency graph in-memory and traverse it to generate software stacks.
These software stacks are used in dependency-monkey (see seed randomly
selecting possible software stacks) as well as in recommendations where this
dependency graph is traversed to generate possible software stacks that are
subsequently scored.

A node in this graph is PackageVersion. The graph can be seen as N-ary tree,
but as there can be cyclic deps in the Python ecosystem, we need to consider
cycles (see caching).
